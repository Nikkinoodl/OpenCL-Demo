# OpenCL-Demo
A simple demonstration of the OpenTK.Compute wrapper for OpenCL in a .NET7, C# WinForms project

I built this project to try out OpenCL in an environment that I'm comfortable with. There were few examples of this already available, so I
tried to document the code as much as possible to make it useful for for anyone looking to start from scratch.

This application simply multiplies two integers together, but does it in the GPU, not the CPU. It requires a non-trivial amount of coding to
actually make that happen, but with the template built it would be straightforward to expand it to do something more substantial.
